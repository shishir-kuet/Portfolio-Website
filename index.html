                <h2>Programming Languages:</h2>
                <h2>C++ & Python</h2>
                <p>
                    I have developed strong proficiency in C++ and Python, C++ helps me understand low-level programming concepts and efficient memory management, while Python is my go-to language for rapid development, automation, and exploring Machine Learning and AI.

                <h2>Web Development:</h2>
                <h2> HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, user-friendly web interfaces. These core web technologies have allowed me to build dynamic frontends and enhance user experience in my full-stack projects. They are essential tools that bridge the gap between design and functionality.

                <h2>Framework & Backend:</h2>
                <h2> Laravel</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose Laravel as my primary backend framework because of its elegant syntax and robust features, which simplify complex web application development. It enables me to build secure and scalable systems, such as the Food Ordering and Banking projects I‚Äôve completed.

                <h2> Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about Machine Learning and AI, focusing on developing intelligent algorithms and data-driven models. These skills open up new possibilities for automation, analytics, and problem-solving beyond traditional programming.

                <h2> VS Code & XAMPP </h2>
                <p>
                   Using VS Code as my main code editor and XAMPP as a local server environment enhances my development workflow. These tools provide flexibility, ease of testing, and efficient project management across different types of applications.

                <h2> & LeetCode </h2>
                <p>
              I actively participate in competitive programming and solve problems on LeetCode to sharpen my algorithmic thinking. This practice helps me approach complex problems with optimized solutions and improves my readiness for technical interviews.
